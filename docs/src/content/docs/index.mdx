GIIN makes use of MS Excel to create data or content in games. It uses a simple scripting language to create **game objects** and **interactions**.

Watch a demo to see it in action.

## Prerequisites

- MS Excel with `xlwings` installed
- NodeJS

## Roadmap

- A library of common UI and UX components for various game interactions and states.
- Stat creation and management. 
  - This means users are able to create stats, such as Energy, Hit Points (HP), Stamina, or any other stat.
- Data export through MS Excel.
- Image and 2D particle support.

## Inspiration

- The [SCUMM game engine](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/the-scumm-diary-stories-behind-one-of-the-greatest-game-engines-ever-made). See the **Learning SCUMM** and **The SCUMM advantage** sections of the linked article.
- The Sleipnir game engine, which was used for a variety of [Adventure games](https://hogs.fandom.com/wiki/Boomzap_Entertainment). It supported Hidden Object and various Puzzle mechanics.
