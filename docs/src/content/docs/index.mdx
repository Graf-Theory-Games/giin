**Generic Incremental Interactive eNgine (GIIN)** is a game engine for menu-driven games on the web. It is currently in early development.

GIIN makes use of MS Excel to create data (content) in games. It uses a simple scripting language to create instances of objects, which are then manipulated by the player through the game's logic.

Watch a demo to see it in action.
