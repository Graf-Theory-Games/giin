**Generic Incremental Interactive eNgine (GIIN)** is a game engine for menu-driven games on the web, currently in early development.

GIIN makes use of MS Excel to create data or content in games. This enables you to easily create stats or any other attribute for your player characters, creatures, and more in a tabular and intuitive environment.

Watch a demo to see it in action.

## About the engine

### Inspiration

- The [SCUMM game engine](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/the-scumm-diary-stories-behind-one-of-the-greatest-game-engines-ever-made). See the **Learning SCUMM** and **The SCUMM advantage** sections of the linked article.
- The Sleipnir game engine, which was used for a variety of [Adventure games](https://hogs.fandom.com/wiki/Boomzap_Entertainment). It supported hidden object and various puzzle mechanics.
